**Step 1**: Html file will have a `‘p’` tag and a `button`

**Step 2**: The `p` tag will show the count which is initially 0. (initially the value in local storage is 0)

**Step 3**: Every time after clicking the number will be increased by 1. & the result will be show in the p tag.

**Step 4**; With every click on the button, the result will be stored in local storage also.

**Step 5**: Now the result is stored in local storage. So, if you reload the page or close the tab & open again, the result of “the count” is not 0. Rather it will show the value from the local storage without reset.
